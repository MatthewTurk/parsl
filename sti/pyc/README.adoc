= Simple C-Python Example

The program is called py-eval.  Its arguments are:
1. A Python script that is executed with no return value.
2. A Python expression that returns a string.

This has been tested with Python 2.7.10 and Python 3.6m.

For more verbose output, set verbose=true in py-eval.c

You may need to set environment variable PYTHONHOME at runtime to agree with PYTHON_HOME in the Makefile.

Transcript:
----
# edit Makefile for Python installation settings
make
export PYTHONHOME=...
./py-eval py/import-io.py py/hello.py
----

To test the exception handling capabilities, do:
----
./py-eval py/err.py py/hello.py
